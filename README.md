Week 7: Network Access Layer
Objectives:
- Understand and implement error detection and correction techniques.
- Simulate network behaviors and analyze performance metrics.

Exercises (Week 7)

a. Single-Bit Parity Check
Objective: Implement a single-bit parity check for 8-bit data.
What I Learned: Single-bit parity checks are effective for detecting single-bit errors but cannot correct errors or detect multiple-bit errors.

b. 2D Parity Check
Objective: Perform a 2D parity check to detect and correct errors in a block of data.
What I Learned: 2D parity checks can detect multiple-bit errors and correct single-bit errors, making them more robust than single-bit parity checks.

c. Checksum Using One's Complement
Objective: Implement a checksum using one's complement for error detection.
What I Learned: One's complement checksums are widely used in networking protocols like TCP, UDP, and IP for efficient error detection.

2. Multiple Access Protocols (MAP)
Objective: Model and compare the performance of Pure ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, and CSMA/CD.
What I Learned: Slotted ALOHA improves the efficiency of Pure ALOHA by dividing time into slots, and its efficiency can be visualized using simulations.
