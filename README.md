Week 1: No LAB
--------------------------------------------------------
No lab exercises were conducted in Week 1.

Week 2: Networks Fundamentals
--------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
Learn Python basics, including data types, conditions, loops, and functions.
Implement simple Python scripts for arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and control flow.
Build small applications like a password strength checker and a Caesar cipher.

Key Learnings
- Python Basics: I learned how to write Python scripts for arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and control flow.
- Practical Applications: The exercises helped me understand how Python can be used for practical tasks like password checking and encryption.

Week 3: Application Layer in Networks
--------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
Understand the application layer and its role in network communication.
Implement HTTP clients and servers using Python's socket and requests libraries.
Fetch data from APIs and analyze network routes using traceroute.

Key Learnings
- HTTP Requests: I learned how to use the socket library for low-level network communication and the requests library for simplified HTTP requests.
- Network Tracing: I gained practical experience in fetching web pages, sending data to servers, and analyzing network routes.



Week 4: Transport Layer in Networks Part 1
--------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
Explore UDP communication and its use cases.
Build UDP client-server applications.
Integrate APIs with UDP communication and implement basic encryption.

Key Learnings
- UDP Communication: I learned how to build UDP servers and clients, handle authentication, and encrypt messages.
- API Integration: I gained experience in fetching data from APIs and transmitting it over UDP.

Week 5: Transport Layer Part 2
--------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
Understand TCP communication and its reliability features.
Build TCP client-server applications, including file transfer and chat systems.
Handle multiple clients concurrently using threading.

Key Learnings
- TCP Communication: I learned how to build TCP servers and clients, measure transmission times, and implement a chat system.
- File Transfer: I gained experience in transferring files over TCP and handling multiple clients using threading.


Week 6: Internet Layer
--------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
Understand IP addressing, including classful and classless addressing (CIDR).
Simulate DHCP operations using Python.
Analyze and manipulate IP addresses programmatically.

Key Learnings
- IP Addressing: I learned about classful and classless addressing (CIDR) and how to analyze IP addresses programmatically.
- DHCP: I gained experience in simulating the DHCP DORA process (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge).


Week 7: Network Access Layer
--------------------------------------------------------
Objectives
Understand and implement error detection and correction techniques.
Simulate network behaviors and analyze performance metrics.

Key Learnings
- Error Detection: I learned how to implement single-bit parity checks, 2D parity checks, and checksums using one's complement.
- Multiple Access Protocols: I gained experience in modeling and comparing the performance of Pure ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, and CSMA/CD.


Reflection
--------------------------------------------------------
This module has provided me with a strong foundation in networking concepts and Python programming. I have gained hands-on experience in building network applications, simulating protocols, and analyzing network behaviors. The weekly exercises have helped me understand the practical applications of networking concepts, and I feel confident in my ability to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.
